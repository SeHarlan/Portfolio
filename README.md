I am a Full Stack Software Engineer who thrives on building relationships with diverse teams and tackling complex challenges. A background in customer service gives me a unique focus on a client's perspective and overall satisfaction. During the various team sprints Iâ€™ve contributed to, I have discovered one of my greatest joys is coming up with unique ideas that solve root problems. I highly value companies that support direct communication, creativity and professional development.

In my personal life I love nothing more than expressing myself through music. This includes playing in bands like Seance Crasher and producing my own songs and compositions.
