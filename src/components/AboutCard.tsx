      <p>Simply put, I love to code. I love to push my intellectual and creative abilities as far as they will go and then push further. I thrive while building relationships with diverse teams and collaborating with them to tackle complex challenges.</p>
      <p>A background in customer service gives me a unique focus on a client's perspective and their overall satisfaction. As a lifelong musician and critical thinker, nothing excites me more than implementing creative ideas to solve technical problems at their root, especially when the results is improvement of other's well-being. I love to execute these ideas with cleanly typed and well organized code, leading to sustainable programs that are easy to maintain and collaborate on.</p>
